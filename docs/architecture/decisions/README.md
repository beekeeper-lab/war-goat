# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains architectural decisions made for the War Goat project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architectural Decision Record captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future team members (and AI agents) understand why decisions were made.
