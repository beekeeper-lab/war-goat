# Integration Gate Report: Component Tests for React UI

## Work Item
- **ID**: T002
- **QA Report**: workflow/T002/4-qa-report.md
- **Branch**: chore/T002

## Pre-Integration State

### Pre-Rebase Commit
```
398c09d docs: comprehensive documentation update
```

### Pre-Rebase Test Baseline
```bash
# Command
npx vitest run

# Result
Test Files  8 passed (8)
     Tests  214 passed (214)
  Duration  6.08s
```

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Fetch Latest Main
```bash
git fetch origin main
# Remote HEAD: 398c09d docs: comprehensive documentation update
```

### Step 2: Rebase onto Main
```bash
git rebase origin/main
# Result: success (already up to date)
# New HEAD: 6023146 test(T002): add comprehensive component tests for React UI
```

### Merge Commits Since Branch Creation
| SHA | Author | Date | Message |
|-----|--------|------|---------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A | Branch was created from latest main - no intervening commits |

## Post-Integration Verification

### Test Results
```bash
npx vitest run
# Exit code: 0
```

| Suite | Pre-Merge | Post-Merge | Delta |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Unit (Backend) | 47 pass | 47 pass | 0 |
| Unit (Frontend) | 167 pass | 167 pass | 0 |
| **Total** | **214 pass** | **214 pass** | **0** |

## Regression Analysis

### New Test Failures (if any)

|------|------|----------------|
| None | N/A | No test failures |

### Tests That Started Passing (bonus)
| Test | File | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| N/A | N/A | No changes - all tests pass in both states |

## Evidence Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| evidence/integration-gate/pre-rebase-tests.txt | Test baseline before changes |
| evidence/integration-gate/post-rebase-tests.txt | Post-merge test results |
| evidence/integration-gate/rebase-output.txt | Rebase operation log |
| evidence/integration-gate/build-output.txt | Build output log |

## Checkpoint Summary

| Checkpoint | Status | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| qa_approved | Pass | 4-qa-report.md (qa_verdict: approved) |
| rebase_clean | Pass | rebase-output.txt (up to date) |
| tests_pass_post_merge | Pass | post-rebase-tests.txt (214 pass) |
| build_succeeds | Pass | build-output.txt (exit 0) |
| no_regressions | Pass | Pre/post comparison identical |

## Integration Verdict

**Verdict**: APPROVED

**Reason**: All integration gate checkpoints passed:
- QA approved the implementation
- Rebase completed cleanly (branch was already up to date with main)
- All 214 tests pass after rebase
- Build succeeds
- No regressions detected (identical results pre and post merge)

### Ready for PR
- All integration checks passed
- No conflicts or regressions detected
- Branch is ready to merge to main
