Welcome to this video about Claude Code Hooks. Today we are going to explore advanced agentic coding techniques. Hooks allow you to customize Claude Code behavior by running shell commands at specific points in the workflow. You can use pre-tool-use hooks to validate or modify tool inputs before execution. Post-tool-use hooks let you process results after tools complete. This enables powerful automation patterns like auto-formatting code, running linters, or triggering builds. The hooks system is incredibly flexible and opens up many possibilities for customizing your development workflow with Claude Code.
